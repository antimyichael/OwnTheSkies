# OwnTheSkies - Advanced Mace PvP Combat Mod

A Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.21.9+ that implements advanced mace PvP techniques, including weapon swapping, armor swapping, and automated aerial combat sequences based on competitive mace combat strategies.

## Features

### Core Mace PvP Techniques

#### 1. **Auto-Attack (Never Miss Your Swing!)** ðŸ†•
Automatically swings your mace when falling to ensure you never miss the critical moment and take unnecessary fall damage.

- **Automatic swing detection** - Triggers when you're falling with mace equipped
- **Smart targeting** - Attacks nearby enemies within 4 blocks
- **Fall damage prevention** - Swings automatically when close to ground (within 2 blocks)
- **One attack per fall** - Only attacks once to prevent spam
- **50ms cooldown** - Prevents accidental double attacks

#### 2. **Sword/Axe Swapping** (Nearly Doubles Damage!)
The most fundamental technique in mace PvP - automatically swaps from your sword/axe to mace **right before** landing the hit to transfer damage and attack speed bonuses.

- Hold **Netherite Axe** or **Netherite Sword** while falling
- Mod automatically switches to **Mace** at the optimal moment (within 2-3 blocks of target)
- Can increase damage from 3.5 hearts to 6+ hearts
- **Netherite Axe is statistically preferred** for maximum damage boost

#### 2. **Elytra to Chestplate Swapping**
Critical technique for aerial mace combat - the mace cannot deal falling damage while gliding with elytra!

- Automatically detects when you're falling with elytra equipped
- Swaps to chestplate mid-fall to apply **full accumulated fall damage**
- Swaps back to elytra after landing for continued mobility
- Note: Manual left-click may be required for armor swap in some cases

#### 3. **Auto-Switching System**
- **Falling (0.5+ blocks/tick)**: Switches to sword/axe for weapon swap technique
- **Fast Falling (2.5+ blocks/tick)**: Direct mace switch for spam clicking
- **After Landing**: Automatically switches back to mobility items
- **Ascending/Gliding**: Ensures mobility items are ready

## How to Use

### Setup Your Hotbar
For optimal performance, have these items in your hotbar:

**Essential:**
- Mace (with Density 5 or Breach 4)
- Netherite Axe (preferred) or Netherite Sword
- Elytra (equipped in chest slot)
- Netherite Chestplate

**Mobility:**
- Wind Charges
- Firework Rockets
- Ender Pearls

**Optional:**
- Shield (for defense)
- Strength Potions (for Breach mace builds)

### Basic Combat Flow

1. **Launch**: Press `R` for automated launch or use wind charges/ender pearls manually
2. **Ascend**: Hold sword/axe while rising (weapon swap technique)
3. **Fall**: Mod automatically switches to mace at optimal moment
4. **Strike**: Land the hit for massive damage
5. **Repeat**: Mod switches back to mobility items automatically

### Advanced Techniques

#### Weapon Swapping (Manual Trigger)
- Hold Netherite Axe while falling
- Attack just before landing - mod switches to mace automatically
- Nearly doubles your damage output

#### Ender Pearl Catch
- Throw an Ender Pearl upward
- Throw a Wind Charge to catch the pearl and boost yourself
- Quick vertical ascent for mace strike

#### Backstab
- Boost up behind shielded opponent
- Attack from behind where shield doesn't protect
- Highly effective against defensive players

#### Spam Clicking Mode
- When falling extremely fast (2.5+ blocks/tick), spam click
- Registers damage per block even with low swing animation
- Useful when timing single hit is difficult
